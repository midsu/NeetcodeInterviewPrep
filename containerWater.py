Given n non-negative intergers where eah represent a point of coordinate (i, a1) . 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
find two lines, which together with x-axis, forms a container constains the most water.

Input: height [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7] 
Output: 49
Explaination; the vertical lines are represented by array [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7], 
In this case the max area of water(blue section), the container can contain is 49.
